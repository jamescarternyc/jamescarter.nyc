			<p class ="push-down paragraph"> Asiah decided to run her blog with Wordpress, a popular content management system which makes it easy for users to update their site's content.</p>
			<img id ="dgMath"class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/customize.jpg" data-bottom-top="opacity:0;" data-center ="opacity:1;">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph">To work within her budget and provide a quick turn-around time, I hand-picked a premium theme to serve as the foundation for the site rather than completely build everything from scratch. Then, with a little front-end magic, I customized everything to her liking.

			<img class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/thtFWordBrowser.jpg" data-bottom-top="opacity:0;" data-center ="opacity:1;">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph">The site is forthright in design. Users have access to all of That F Word's social media on the left &amp; can enjoy all of Asiah's exciting posts on the right.
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph">I simplified the content viewing process with <i>infinite scroll</i>. Users simply scroll down to reveal more posts instead of having to click page by page to load older content. Infinite scroll also allows users to view the blog's content in a manner they are already accustomed to when using apps such as Twitter &amp; Instagram.  
			</p>	
			<p class = "paragraph"> Asiah wanted the blog to be minimalistic in design, but incredibly functional in terms of current &amp; future usage. So, I used the sidebar as a central hub where Asiah can connect her audience with her social media presence, provide users with archives to find older content, &amp; upload future advertisements.

			<p class ="push-down col-sm-8 paragraph">To help promote her blog, Asiah initiated a campaign via Instagram entitled, <i>#HeyThereGorgeous</i>. Whenever she has spare time (she's still in school), Asiah travels around the DMV area looking to capture the local women's fashion scene with her camera. To ensure all these wonderful images would be accessible on the blog, I made use of a simple light box gallery.

		<div class ="col-sm-8">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph">The wonderful thing about working with Asiah is that for the most part, she knew what she wanted and what she didn't want. This not only made designing the logo fun and easy, but was also extremely important because it allowed us to stay on schedule and budget. 
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph">Asiah knew she wanted go with a basic word mark for the logo. To add a bit of boldness &amp; character to the page, we went with a mustard colored hand font with a dropshadow to really make it pop against the white background.

		<div class = "col-sm-8">
			<p class ="paragraph"> Asiah also needed some business cards to pass out during her #HeyThereGorgeous campaign. However, instead of the usual structure that includes her name and contact info, she desired a card that would extend the experience of #HeyThereGorgeous by providing instructions on what women should do after having their picture taken.

		<div class ="col-sm-2"></div>
		<div class ="col-sm-8">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph"> To break away from the typical routine, a card with rounded edges was chosen. Sticking with Asiah's main goal of simplicity and to ensure maximum readability. the card features a white background and a black serif font. Asiah also wanted to remind partcipants that fashion is her passion, so one of her favorite fashion quotes was inlcuded on the back of the card.

		<div class ="col-sm-2"></div>
		<div class ="col-sm-8">
			<p class =" push-down paragraph">One major challenge I experienced while designing, was the lack of real-estate the minicard provided for the content. However, in a way, the same lack of space led to a clearer sense of minimalism by forcing a simpler set of instructions and a straightforward text layout.
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph"> Overall, I had a blast working on this project and look forward to working on more projects with Asiah in the future. </p>
