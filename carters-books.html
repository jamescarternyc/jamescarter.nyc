				</h2>
				<p class = "paragraph"> Recently, Jacob Carter (yes we're related) enlisted me to help him create, design, &amp; distribute his very own children's book entitled, "Who Am I?". Midway through the project, he realized he didn't just want to make one book and call it quits. So, we went ahead and made a book company, Carter's Books. 
				</p>
				<p class ="paragraph">This was my second time working with Jake, and my first time getting to collaborate with illustrator, Jason Merrit. The project itself came about as a response to the seemingly incessant violence, devastation, and hopelessness currently consuming the black community &amp; America as a whole.
				</p>
				<p class ="paragraph"> Conversation is a great way to suggest solutions to problems. But, when it's all said and done, bumping one's gums won't get one very far in life. It takes physical action to make any solution a reality. The creation of "Who Am I" is the first of many actions we plan to make to help make a difference.

				Story Board
			</h2>
			<p class ="paragraph"> When we started, Jacob had already finished writing the story. He had an idea of how he wanted the book to look, but he wasn't quite sure about how the story would pan out in terms of pages. So, after figuring out the basics: book size, pg count, etc., I suggested we create a story board to get the ball rolling. I would also like to point out only a few sketches came from Jacob &amp; myself. We left the bulk of the pencil work to Jason.
			</p>

			<p class ="push-down paragraph">The first round of drawings were dedicated to simply developing the story into different scenes that would spread across 20+ pages. Afterwards, we revised and refined each sketch until we had a clear understanding of how we wanted the main character of the book to look.
			</p>
			<img id ="dgMath" class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/cb/storyboard2.png"data--200-bottom-top="opacity:0;" data-top="opacity:1;">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph">After several rounds of revision, we wound up transforming story's main character, "Jacob", from a purely fictional being to an entity completely relatable to today's black youth with his joggers, Yeezys, and Mohawk.
			</p>
			<h2 class ="push-down prj-title">
			Graphic Design
			</h2>
			<p class ="paragraph">After storyboarding, it was time to take the sketches from paper to the computer screen and bring Jason's artwork to life. Some of the tools I used to accomplish this included Photoshop, Illustrator, &amp; InDesign. 
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph">Jacob wanted each scene to mix the drawings in with everyday real world items. To accomplish this, we cut out magazine clippings, scanned them onto my computer, &amp; collaged them together in photoshop to make the backgrounds of each scene. 
			</p>
			<img class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/cb/magazineClips.jpg" data--200-bottom-top="clip-path: inset(25% 25% 0 0);" data-top="clip-path: inset(-100% -100% 0 0);">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph">Choosing to hand-cut the majority of magazine clips really added an extra degree of texture and character to each scene.
			</p>
			<img class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/cb/magazineClip2.jpg" data--200-bottom-top="clip-path: inset(25% 25% 0 0);" data-top="clip-path: inset(-100% -100% 0 0);">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph"> Seeing as this project is a children's STORY, one of the most crucial elements I had to consider was type. As a father, Jacob reads often to his children. One complaint he had was that the font sizes were too small &amp; as a result he would lose his place. To remedy this, I went with a 24 pt. font.
			</p>
			<img class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/cb/type2.jpg" data--200-bottom-top="clip-path: inset(25% 25% 0 0);" data-top="clip-path: inset(-100% -100% 0 0);">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph"> We had a lot going on visually, so I needed to ensure that outside of just increasing font-size, the words themselves would have maximum readbility.
			</p>
			<img class ="push-down prj-box" src ="/img/cb/type.jpg" data--200-bottom-top="clip-path: inset(25% 25% 0 0);" data-top="clip-path: inset(-100% -100% 0 0);">
			<p class ="push-down paragraph"> Accomplishing this required a few things:
			</p>
			<p class = "paragraph">1. The story features a lot of couplets &amp; quatrains. Therefore, I broke up the text in a way that would help readers easily pick up on the rhyme schemes and would match up with the scenes in the background.
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph">2. Studies suggest that text is most easily read when colored black on a white background (I think it's pretty obvious what I chose to do).
			</p>
			<p class ="paragraph">3. After giving the type a white background, I realized that it was competing with the background imagery, which wasn't a good thing. Therefore, I gave each line its own white background and left the spaces in between empty.

			<p class ="push-down paragraph">With the storyboard completed, I now needed to take Jason's sketches of Jacob &amp; bring them to life digitally. Accomplishing this required my knowledge of coloring, vector graphics, &amp; a shameful amount of caffeine. Doing this &amp; being the guy that was able to photoshop yeezys on Jacob's feet from every angle imaginable are definitely some of the moments I enjoyed most while working on this project.

Ultimately, Celery was a perfect fit because of its ease of use and flexiblity.

			<p class ="push-down paragraph">I knew Jacob would be attending plenty of child-friendly venues, so I designed the cards to attract their attention. As a result, I added a gradient to the type.

			<p class ="paragraph">Also, I had the edges of each card colored, so that when stacked, they create a uniform color-block that really catches the eye.

			<p class ="push-down paragraph">Finally, I not only wanted the cards to attract the attention of the eyes, but to feel good to the touch. So I chose a thick cotton stock to add a degree of texture not found on standard cards.
